Project Proposal: Mad-Libs Game


Team Members: Jaylyn Bido (jab9633) and Eliza Insley (epi2005)


Overview: This program would allow users to pick from a variety of genres and create a
MadLibs storyline based on their choice. They would first select a genre, and upon choosing, be
introduced to a fill-in-blank short story. They would type in their own words or phrases in the
blanks, and when complete, hit submit. This will open a new window with their story displayed,
and they will have an option to save it to their computer as a file, return to the homepage to
create a new story, enter a library full of their old stories, or exit the program.
